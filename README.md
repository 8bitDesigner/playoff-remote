# What is this thing?

I really can't stand commercials in live TV. And when the NHL playoffs come
around, that's what I'm stuck doing. So I've skteched up this super simple
remote based off of [this tutorial on Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-an-infrared-library)
so I can mute and unmute my TV with one giant red button.
